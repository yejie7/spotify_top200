This directory contains codes that I used to create the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelexa/spotify200
To create the dataset, I downloaded the csv files from the 'Weekly Top Songs' charts on Spotify Charts for each country from the week of 2021/02/04 ~ 2022/07/14. I used concat.py to create one combined file for each country, then used data.py to collect additional data for each song from the Spotify API.
